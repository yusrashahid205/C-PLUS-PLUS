# C-PLUS-PLUS
We first include the iostream header file that allows us to display output.
The cout object is defined inside the std namespace.
To use the std namespace, we used the using namespace std; statement.
Every C++ program starts with the main() function.
The code execution begins from the start of the main() function.
cout is an object that prints the string inside quotation marks " ".
It is followed by the &lt;&lt; operator. return 0; is the "exit status" of the main() function.
The program ends with this statement, however, this statement is not mandatory.
